## Workshop Overview

Scientific research is almost exclusively published in unstructured text formats, which are not readily machine-readable. While technological approaches can help to get this flood of scientific information and new knowledge under control, the development of such technologies is very complex in practice and hinders the creation of infrastructures and systems to track research and assist the scientific community with applications such as dedicated scientific search engines and recommender systems. **The 3rd International Workshop on Natural Scientific Language Processing (NSLP 2026)** aims to bring together researchers working on the processing, analysis, transformation and making-use-of scientific language including all relevant sub-topics. NSLP 2026 is a full-day workshop co-located with [LREC 2026](https://www.elra.info/lrec2026/) to be held in Palma de Mallorca, Spain in May 2026. The workshop consists of a keynote speaker as well as presentations and posters of accepted papers. 

In addition, the workshop offers **three shared tasks**:

* [ClimateCheck 2026: Scientific Fact-Checking of Social Media Claims](https://nfdi4ds.github.io/nslp2026/docs/climatecheck_shared_task.html)
* [SciVQA 2026: Scientific Visual Question Answering](https://nfdi4ds.github.io/nslp2026/docs/scivqa_shared_task.html)
* [SOMD 2026: Software Mention Disambiguation and Coreference Resolution](https://nfdi4ds.github.io/nslp2026/docs/somd_shared_task.html)
  
Participants can sign up for one or more (sub-)tasks. Automated evaluations of submitted systems are done through the Codabench platform.

## Important dates

* Paper submission deadline: **February 20, 2026 (tbc; not to be extended)**
* Notification of acceptance: **March 13, 2026 (tentative)**
* Camera-ready submission: **March 27, 2026 (tentative)**
