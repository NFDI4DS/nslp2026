# SOMDi2026: Software Mention Disambiguation

Understanding software mentions is crucial for reproducibility and to interpret experimental results. Citations of software are often informal, lacking the use of persistent identifiers, making it hard to infer and disambiguate knowledge about software efficiently. This task will build on SOMD 2025 (run at SDP 2025, co-located with ACL 2025) and focus on entity disambiguation as an under-investigated problem in this context. More precisely, SOMDi2026 will tackle the following tasks:
1. Corerference resolution of software mentions: Given a pair (E1, E2) of software entities, determine whether they refer to the same real-world software. 
2. Entity disambiguation: Similar to the first subtask. However, a set of target software entities is provided. Participants should disambiguate provided entity mentions to this target set. 
3. Large-scale entity disambiguation: The entity disambiguation task for software mentions is conducted on a larger training and validation set, thus increasing the space for disambiguation to cover entities in approximately a million scientific articles.
