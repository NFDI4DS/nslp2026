# ClimateCheck 2026: Scientific Fact-Checking of Social Media Claims

The rise of climate discourse on social media offers new channels for public engagement but also amplifies mis- and disinformation. As online platforms increasingly shape public understanding of science, tools that ground claims in trustworthy, peer-reviewed evidence are necessary. The new iteration of ClimateCheck builds on the results and insights from the 2025 iteration (run at SDP 2025/ACL 2025), offering the following tasks:

1. **Abstract retrieval and claim verification**: given a claim and corpus of publications, retrieve the top 10 most relevant abstracts and classify each claim-abstract pair as supports, refutes, or not enough information. 
2. **Disinformation narrative detection**: given a claim, detect whether it contains a climate-disinformation narrative according to a predefined taxonomy.
3. 
New training data will be released for both tasks, with task 1 having triple the amount of the last iteration. The new iteration will focus on sustainability, emphasising the need to build climate-friendly NLP systems with minimal environmental impact. 


More information on data, organisrs, and important dates will be available soon.
