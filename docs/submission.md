# Submission guidelines

The NSLP 2026 workshop invites submissions of: regular long papers; short papers; position papers. We especially encourage submissions from junior researchers and students from diverse backgrounds.

* We will **not accept work that is under review or has already been published in or accepted for** publication in a journal, another conference, or another workshop.
* The workshop invites anonymous submissions of regular **long papers (up to 8 pages without references and appendix)**; **short papers** as well as **position papers (up to 4 pages without references and appendix)** presenting, for example, negative results, in-progress projects, or demos.
* Authors are permitted to include an optional appendix of up to 2 pages. However, reviewers will not be mandated to review the appendix and all papers must be self-contained.
* Reviewing will be performed **double-blind**. Reviewers will not actively try to identify the authors.
* Submissions **must be in PDF**, formatted in the **LREC 2026 style**.
* The proceedings of this workshop will be published as part of the **LREC 2026 proceedings in the ACL Anthology** (full Open Access).
* At least **one author per contribution must register** for the workshop for presentation.
* All submissions are done via **START (Softconf)** – <a href="https://softconf.com/lrec2026/NSLP2026/">https://softconf.com/lrec2026/NSLP2026/</a>.

When submitting a paper from the START page, the authors will be asked to provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e., also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your research. Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC authors to share the described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and replicability of experiments (including evaluation ones).
