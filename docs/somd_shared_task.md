<h1> SOMD 2026: Software Mention Detection and Coreference Resolution </h1>
</div>
We address the task of coreference resolution of software mentions across multiple documents, i.e. given a set of software mentions extracted from multiple scientific publications, related extracted attributes as well as sentences in which these occur, cluster these mentions so that all software mentions in a particular cluster refer to the same real world software. 
This task will build on [SOMD 2025](https://sdproc.org/2025/sharedtasks.html#somd) (run at [SDP 2025](https://sdproc.org/2025/), co-located with ACL 2025) and focus on entity disambiguation via coreference resolution as an under-investigated problem in this context. More precisely, SOMDi2026 will tackle the following tasks:

**Subtask 1:** Software coreference resolution over gold standard mentions.
Addresses the task based on high-quality (gold standard) mentions of software that are expert-annotated in multiple publications.

**Subtask 2:** Software coreference resolution over predicted mentions.
Addresses the task on software mentions that are automatically extracted using a baseline model, i.e. reflecting a typical information extraction scenario, where upstream pipelines (such as entity and metadata extraction) are imperfect. 

**Subtask 3:** Software coreference resolution at scale. 
For this subtask, we provide predicted mentions of software and metadata at a larger scale. This challenges models to scale effectively, maintain accuracy, and distinguish among an increasingly dense field of similar or overlapping software mentions.
